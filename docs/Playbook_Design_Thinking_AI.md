# Sabora — Design Thinking Playbook (AI‑Evolved) · v2025-08-18

**Purpose**: Operational guide for building Sabora with human‑in‑the‑loop AI. Use across **Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver → Operate**.

## Principles
1) People first, agents as force‑multipliers.  
2) Transparent by default (assumptions + sources).  
3) Guardrails: allergies, sodium, budget, culture.  
4) Global: EN / PT‑BR / ES + units and ingredient synonyms.  
5) Measure to improve (TTFP, swap friction, adherence).

## Roles
- **Editor‑in‑Chief (You):** approves gates.  
- **Orchestrator:** routes work across agents and evaluators.  
- **Specialists:** Discovery, UX System, Content/Nutrition, Planning, Shopping, Localization, Frontend, Backend, QA/Eval, Docs/Community.

## Gates
- **D1 Discover:** Problem frame, JTBD, success metrics.  
- **D2 Define:** IA, flows, tokens, policy defaults (prep time, budget tiers).  
- **D3 Develop:** Planner/List + guardrails passing; localization set.  
- **D4 Deliver:** Release scope/notes; telemetry opt‑in copy.  
- **O1 Operate:** Scorecard → next sprint bets.

## Metrics
- **North Star:** Healthy meals followed / week per active user.  
- Inputs: TTFP < 90s, swap ≤ 3 taps, ingredient overlap %, budget compliance %, cuisine diversity score, a11y adoption %, localization coverage %.

## Ethics
- Not medical advice.  
- Strict allergen blocking; sodium budget.  
- Privacy: local‑first default; minimal PII; consented telemetry.

## Workflow (high‑level)
1. Collect prefs → 2. Plan week → 3. Nutrition check → 4. Cost check → 5. Listify → 6. Persist → 7. Localize → 8. Return.
